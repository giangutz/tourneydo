### 🔧 **Implementation Details**

#### **Payment Workflow:**
```typescript
1. Coach selects team and reviews roster
2. Coach can edit player information if needed
3. Coach can remove players (dynamic price update)
4. Coach selects payment method and enters reference
5. Payment submitted with "pending_approval" status
6. Organizer reviews payment in approval center
7. Organizer approves/rejects with notes
8. All participants automatically marked as paid/pending
```

#### **Multi-Team Coach Logic:**
```typescript
const fetchCoachTeams = async () => {
  // Get all teams managed by coach
  const teams = await supabase
    .from("teams")
    .select("*")
    .eq("coach_id", coachId);
    
  // Get registration counts per team
  const teamsWithStats = await Promise.all(
    teams.map(async (team) => {
      const registrations = await getTeamRegistrations(team.id);
      return {
        ...team,
        registrationCount: registrations.length,
        totalAmount: registrations.length * tournament.entry_fee,
        paymentStatus: calculatePaymentStatus(registrations)
      };
    })
  );
};
```

#### **Payment Approval System:**
```typescript
const approvePayment = async (paymentId, notes) => {
  // Update payment status
  await supabase
    .from("team_payments")
    .update({ 
      status: "approved", 
      processed_at: new Date(),
      notes 
    })
    .eq("id", paymentId);
    
  // Mark all participants as paid
  await supabase
    .from("tournament_registrations")
    .update({ payment_status: "paid" })
    .in("id", payment.registration_ids);
};
```
