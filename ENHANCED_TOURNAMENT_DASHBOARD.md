### 🔧 **Implementation Details**

#### **Division Rules Implementation:**
```typescript
const DIVISION_RULES = {
  gradeschool: {
    name: "Gradeschool",
    ageRange: { min: 5, max: 11 },
    criteria: "height",
    groups: [
      { name: "Group 0", min: 0, max: 120 },
      { name: "Group 1", min: 120, max: 128 },
      // ... 7 total groups
    ]
  },
  cadet: {
    name: "Cadet",
    ageRange: { min: 12, max: 14 },
    criteria: "weight",
    male: [-33, -37, -41, -45, -49, -53, -57, -61, 61],
    female: [-29, -33, -37, -41, -44, -47, -51, -55, 55]
  },
  // ... junior and senior divisions
};
```

#### **Team Separation Algorithm:**
```typescript
const separateTeammates = (participants) => {
  // Group by team
  const teamGroups = groupBy(participants, 'team.name');
  
  // Distribute to avoid first-round conflicts
  const result = [];
  const teams = Object.keys(teamGroups);
  
  // Round-robin team distribution
  teams.forEach(team => {
    if (teamGroups[team].length > 0) {
      result.push(teamGroups[team].shift());
    }
  });
  
  // Continue until all participants placed
  return result;
};
```

#### **Bracket Generation:**
```typescript
const generateSingleEliminationBracket = (participants) => {
  const shuffled = separateTeammates(participants);
  const rounds = Math.ceil(Math.log2(shuffled.length));
  
  // Generate first round with byes
  const firstRound = createFirstRoundMatches(shuffled);
  
  // Create placeholder matches for subsequent rounds
  const subsequentRounds = createPlaceholderMatches(rounds - 1);
  
  return [...firstRound, ...subsequentRounds];
};
```
