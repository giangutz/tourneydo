# ðŸ”§ Fix 404 Route Error

## The Problem
```
GET http://localhost:3000/dashboard/tournaments/e1354812-df33-4394-980d-8b793d8e62bc/edit 404 (Not Found)
```

## The Solution âœ…

### 1. **Stop the Development Server**
Press `Ctrl+C` in your terminal to stop the current dev server.

### 2. **Clear Next.js Cache**
```bash
rm -rf .next
```

### 3. **Restart Development Server**
```bash
pnpm dev
```

### 4. **Test the Route Again**
Navigate to: `/dashboard/tournaments/[tournament-id]/edit`

## Why This Happens
- Next.js App Router caches route information
- New dynamic routes need server restart to be recognized
- The file exists but Next.js hasn't picked it up yet

## Alternative Quick Fix
If the above doesn't work, try:

1. **Hard refresh** the browser (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows)
2. **Check browser console** for any other errors
3. **Verify you're logged in** as an organizer

## File Structure Verification âœ…
The route file exists at the correct location:
```
/app/dashboard/tournaments/[id]/edit/page.tsx
```

This should resolve the 404 error! ðŸš€
