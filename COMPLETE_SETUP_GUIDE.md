## üìä **Monitoring & Analytics**

### **Email Delivery Tracking**

Query email logs for monitoring:

```sql
-- Check email delivery rates
SELECT 
    status,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER(), 2) as percentage
FROM email_logs 
WHERE sent_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY status;

-- Recent email activity
SELECT 
    to_email,
    subject,
    status,
    sent_at
FROM email_logs 
ORDER BY sent_at DESC 
LIMIT 20;
```

### **Member Activity Tracking**

Monitor member engagement:

```sql
-- Active members by organizer
SELECT 
    p.full_name as organizer,
    COUNT(m.id) as total_members,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN m.status = 'active' THEN 1 END) as active_members
FROM profiles p
LEFT JOIN members m ON p.id = m.organizer_id
WHERE p.role = 'organizer'
GROUP BY p.id, p.full_name;

-- Tournament member assignments
SELECT 
    t.name as tournament,
    COUNT(tm.id) as assigned_members,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN tm.role = 'admin' THEN 1 END) as admins,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN tm.role = 'bracket_manager' THEN 1 END) as bracket_managers
FROM tournaments t
LEFT JOIN tournament_members tm ON t.id = tm.tournament_id
GROUP BY t.id, t.name;
```
