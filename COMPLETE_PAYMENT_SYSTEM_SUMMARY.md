4. Coach removes/adds players (dynamic pricing)
5. Coach selects payment method and enters reference
6. Payment submitted with "pending_approval" status
7. Organizer reviews in comprehensive approval center
8. Organizer approves/rejects with detailed notes
9. All participants automatically updated to paid/pending
10. Complete audit trail maintained
```

#### **Multi-Team Coach Logic:**
```typescript
const fetchCoachTeams = async () => {
  // Get all teams managed by coach
  const teams = await supabase
    .from("teams")
    .select("*")
    .eq("coach_id", coachId);
    
  // Calculate stats per team
  const teamsWithStats = await Promise.all(
    teams.map(async (team) => {
      const registrations = await getTeamRegistrations(team.id);
      return {
        ...team,
        registrationCount: registrations.length,
        totalAmount: registrations.length * tournament.entry_fee,
        paymentStatus: calculatePaymentStatus(registrations)
      };
    })
  );
};
```

#### **Registration Management:**
```typescript
const handleBulkRegister = async () => {
  const registrationData = selectedAthletes.map(athleteId => ({
    tournament_id: tournament.id,
    athlete_id: athleteId,
    team_id: selectedTeam,
    payment_status: "pending",
    registration_date: new Date().toISOString()
  }));

  await supabase
    .from("tournament_registrations")
    .insert(registrationData);
};
