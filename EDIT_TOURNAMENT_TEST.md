# Edit Tournament Route Test

## File Structure âœ…
```
/app/dashboard/tournaments/[id]/edit/page.tsx
```

## Route Should Work At:
```
/dashboard/tournaments/[tournament-id]/edit
```

## Example URL:
```
http://localhost:3000/dashboard/tournaments/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000/edit
```

## Troubleshooting Steps:

1. **Restart Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. **Clear Next.js Cache**
   ```bash
   rm -rf .next
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Check Browser Console** for any JavaScript errors

4. **Verify Tournament ID** - Make sure you're using a valid tournament ID from your database

5. **Check Authentication** - Make sure you're logged in as an organizer

## Test the Route:
1. Go to dashboard
2. Click on a tournament
3. Click "Edit Tournament" button
4. Should navigate to `/dashboard/tournaments/[id]/edit`

## If Still Not Working:
The route file exists and is properly structured. The issue is likely:
- Development server cache
- Browser cache
- Invalid tournament ID
- Authentication/permission issue
